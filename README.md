### CF^2-NET: Coarse-to-Fine Fusion Convolutional Network for Breast Ultrasound Image Segmentation

We propose and evaluate a coarse-to-fine
fusion convolutional network (CF2-Net) based on a novel feature integration
strategy (forming an “E”-like type) for BUS image segmentation. To enhance
contour and provide structural information, we concatenate a super-pixel image
and the original image as the input of CF2-Net. Meanwhile, to highlight
the difference of the lesion regions with variable sizes and relieve the im-
balance issue, we further design a weighted-balanced loss function to train
the CF2-Net effectively.
